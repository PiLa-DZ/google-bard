Here is a possible roadmap for learning computer science:

**Foundational courses:**

* Introduction to computer science
* Programming
* Data structures and algorithms
* Operating systems
* Computer architecture

**Advanced courses:**

* Software engineering
* Artificial intelligence
* Machine learning
* Databases
* Computer networks

**Specialized courses:**

* Web development
* Mobile development
* Game development
* Security
* Big data

You can follow this roadmap in any order that you prefer. However, it is generally recommended to take the foundational courses first, before moving on to the advanced and specialized courses.

Here are some specific courses that you may want to consider taking:

* **Introduction to computer science:** This course will teach you the basics of computer science, including programming, algorithms, and data structures.
* **Programming:** This course will teach you how to write code in a programming language, such as Python, Java, or C++.
* **Data structures and algorithms:** This course will teach you about the different types of data structures and algorithms, and how to use them to solve problems.
* **Operating systems:** This course will teach you about the different components of an operating system and how they work together.
* **Computer architecture:** This course will teach you about the hardware components of a computer and how they work together.
* **Software engineering:** This course will teach you about the process of developing software applications.
* **Artificial intelligence:** This course will teach you about the principles of artificial intelligence and how to develop AI applications.
* **Machine learning:** This course will teach you about the principles of machine learning and how to develop machine learning models.
* **Databases:** This course will teach you about the different types of databases and how to use them to store and retrieve data.
* **Computer networks:** This course will teach you about the different types of computer networks and how they work.

Once you have taken some of these courses, you can start to specialize in a particular area of computer science. There are many different specializations available, such as web development, mobile development, game development, security, and big data.

You can also choose to pursue a career in computer science research. If you are interested in conducting research in a particular area of computer science, you can pursue a PhD in computer science.

I hope this roadmap helps you to plan your learning journey in computer science.
